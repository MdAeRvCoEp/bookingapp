## Booking App: Documentation

Firstly, clone this repository and run:

### `npm install`

This will install all of the dependencies on the server.

Some important details:
1. All of these codes are already neatly written. The prop drillings and hooks are there to change the transparency of the Navbar, as well as the 'mode' state in App.js. If you want to alter these variables, you should create a new branch and make a pull request, and I will review the codes.
2. The user mode changing works as expected. Just no persistent sessions yet.
3. We might want to develop and test RESTful APIs for CRUD operations in the future.

Anyways, after you're done with your work, you can deploy the web pages by using:

### `npm run build`
